# sketch-tool
A tool for doing quick figure drawings while watching your favorite media. MLP!

## usage
How it works is pretty simple, it clicks the mouse every 20 and 30 seconds, so if you have a youtube or dailymotion video fullscreened, it will pause and unpause it.

Just start the sketch.py file and play a vid!

Technically this means you could use **any** fullscreened video that pauses when you click on the screen, but that would be going against the intended perpose of this project. It's only for ponies.

## installation
You'll need to have python installed and the PyUserInput python library installed.

Depending on you're system this could mean different things, like typing `pip install PyUserInput` or something else.

Please message me if you get stuck at all. I'd love to have people finding use for my code, and that can't happen if I haven't made it easy enough for any given user. Seriously, open an issue or email me at kixpone@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by!
