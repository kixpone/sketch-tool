# sketch-tool
A tool for doing quick figure drawings while watching your favorite media. MLP!

## usage
How it works is pretty simple, it clicks the mouse every 20 and 30 seconds, so if you have a youtube or dailymotion video fullscreened, it will pause and unpause it.

Just start the sketch.py file and play a vid!

Technically this means you could use **any** fullscreened video that pauses when you click on the screen, but that would be going against the intended perpose of this project. It's only for ponies.

If you want to change the time it waits between pausing or the time it pauses for you to draw, open sketch.py and change the value of 'sketch_time' and 'draw_time' to your desired time in seconds. The default is pretty quick like I like, but you won't be getting much detail in.

## installation
You'll need to have python installed and the PyUserInput python library installed.

Depending on you're system this could mean different things, like typing `pip install PyUserInput` or something else.

Please message me if you get stuck at all. I'd love to have people finding use for my code, and that can't happen if I haven't made it easy enough for any given user. Seriously, open an issue or email me at kixpone@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by!
